                    Looks like we are officially a couple now, honestly, when we matched on tinder, I wont lie, i was not expecting to go this far and deep. Here I am now, writing you a letter on a website I made just for you, crazy how life works sometimes huh? Who would have fucking thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I keep falling in deeper into this rabbit hole with you, and honestly, I don't mind it one bit. You are honestly the most amazing woman I have ever met, and I am so lucky to have you in my life. Your kindness, your humor, your compassion, your cute smile, your sultry eyes. Everything about you just draws me in more and more each day.

                It’s the little things that really got me like the way you’re so shy about your English when I think every word you say is perfect. You told me once that you never met someone who truly wanted to know you, and I want you to know I’ve never been more sure about wanting to know every part of your story. I know you said you’d wait for me to be ready, but the truth is, I’ve been waiting for someone like you this whole time.
            </p>
            <p>
                P.S. you are probably wondering why there is Garfield beside this letter, I didnt know what else to put and you once said you liked Garfield so why not, Just assume this Garfield is me, standing proud.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yours forever and evermore,<br><br>
                Alam, Jobayer, sayang or whichever you prefer.
