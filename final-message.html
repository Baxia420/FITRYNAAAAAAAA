            That is all I had in store for you today. I am sorry if it isn't to your liking, or what you were expecting....I am not really good at coding and this was my first real project so, mistakes were obviously made. I hope you liked it though, it took a lot more time than I am comfortable saying in public. (Also, if anyone asks, i finished this in 2 hours, not the 20+ I actually took, i stopped counting after a certain point).

            This website actually does not allow you to say No, I designed it in such a way, not sure if you tried saying no and saw what happened. I do not want you to feel pressured or anything. If you want to say no, you can say no, the option is open. I have never been one to force something on anyone and I don't intend to change that now.
        </p>

            And that's it, I had some other plans aswell, I wanted to get you flowers today, found a facebook page and everything but you are going back home and taking those flowers back home...Yea..I would not want you to get into trouble. Realistically though, you are gonna get into a lot of trouble for dating me, and for that, I am sorry (Saying sorry now so that I can say I told you so later on LMAO).
